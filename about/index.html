<p><em>Hello, world!</em> After writing a decent amount of texts on UEFI development and reverse engineering <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/CodeRush/articles/">in Russian</a> it's finally time for me to start writing in English, both for improving my language skills and for reaching a broader audience.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Nikolaj Schlej</strong> aka <strong>CodeRush</strong>, author of <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool">UEFITool</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/IFRExtractor-RS">IFRExtractor RS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/CrScreenshotDxe">CrScreenshotDxe</a>, and other UEFI-related things.</p>
<p>I have several years of UEFI development experience at <a href="https://congatec.de">congatec AG</a> (where I worked as Software Engineer BIOS), followed by 8 and a half years of firmware security and low-level software development at <a href="https://apple.com">Apple Inc</a> (where I was a part of SEAR Firmware Security team, and was responsible for eficheck, T2 SecureBoot, M-series SecureBoot, BootPolicy, SEPOS virtualization and other smaller things).</p>
<p>If for some reason you are interested in my education and stuff, my <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0007-2919-7926">ORCID</a> has it all covered. My patents can be found <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/nikolaj-schlej">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm currently <em>funemployed</em> for actively treating personal health issues, and do not plan to return to any job duties until those issues are fully resolved.</p>
