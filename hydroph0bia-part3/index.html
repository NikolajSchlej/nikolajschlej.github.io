<p>This post is likely the final one about a vulnerability I dubbed Hydroph0bia (as a pun on Insyde H2O) aka CVE-2025-4275 or INSYDE-SA-2025002. This part is about checking how Insyde fixed the vulnerability and if it's possible to bypass their fixes.</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>It is always interesting to see how a vulnerability with <a href="https://x.com/binarly_io/status/1934755097613107562">a massive supply chain impact</a> gets fixed by different OEMs, and how fast they could distribute the fix across their fleets.</p>
<p>There been 10 days since the embargo end, and so far the only OEM who successfully delivered BIOS updates with fixes for Hydroph0bia is <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000299521/dsa-2025-149">Dell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/LEN-197020">Lenovo</a> confirmed they are vulnerable, but will deliver the fixes not earlier than 2025-07-30 (later for some models).</p>
<p><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/vulnerable-to-hydroph0bia-secure-boot-bypass-cve-2025-4275/70432/6">Framework</a> confirmed they are vulnerable, but provided no time estimates.</p>
<p>All other affected vendors (Acer, Fujitsu, HP, etc.) haven't published anything relevant yet, neither a security advisory, nor fixed BIOS updates.</p>
<p>Let's do some more reverse engineering and see how Insyde fixed the issue on their side. We can do so by comparing two BIOS updates released by Dell, one <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=g5gn5">right before the fix</a>, and <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=gcwty">the other right after</a>.</p>
<h1 id="unwrapping-the-update-images">Unwrapping the update images</h1>
<p>Before we can compare the images, we need to unwrap them, i.e. remove the data that will not be flashed onto the SPI chip, and is only required for the FW updater application.</p>
<p>This can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/InsydeImageExtractor">InsydeImageExtractor tool</a> I wrote 11 years ago (props to Insyde for not updating the file format, once again the motto is "do not fix what is not broken").</p>
<h1 id="diffing-the-update-images">Diffing the update images</h1>
<p>There are several ways to find a difference between UEFI images, I prefer to start with generating UEFITool reports for them, then comparing the reports with a UI text diffing tool (<a href="https://www.scootersoftware.com/download">Beyond Compare</a> is a good one).
<img src="../hydroph0bia-part3/hp3_compare.png" alt="Reports comparison result" /></p>
<p>Looks like we have a fair amount of changes here, but it's certain that not all of them are related to Hydroph0bia. What we are interested in changes to drivers related to the firmware update process, i.e. <em>BdsDxe</em>, <em>SecurityStubDxe</em>, <em>SecureFlashDxe</em> and alike. Source code updates, especially addions of new code, often make the PE image size bigger, so we expect a fixed driver to be slightly bigger than a vulnerable one.</p>
<p>To compare the PE files, we can use one of the two popular solutions, both natively supported by IDA 9.1: <a href="https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html">bindiff</a> or <a href="https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora">diaphora</a>. I'll be using the second one just because I already have it installed and ready.</p>
<p>The comparison results we have here are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>BdsDxe</em> has the same size (and same base address of 0, so changes could not be explained by relocations alone), likely having minor changes.</li>
<li><em>SecurityStubDxe</em> got a minor size reduction (32 bytes), likely having minor changes.</li>
<li><em>SecureFlashDxe</em> got a decent size increase (704 bytes), likely containing the main fix.</li>
</ul>
<p>After disassembling both copies of <em>BdsDxe</em> the only relevant change is a replacement on a "naked" <em>gRT-&gt;SetVariable</em> call (that could not remove special Insyde variables with AW attribute) with a <em>LibSetSecureVariable</em> call (that uses SMM communication service if available, and will remove such kind of variables).</p>
<p><em>SecurityStubDxe</em> got a minor fix for its handler of <em>ExitBootServices</em> event, the new version still flips a global, but doesn't call gBS-&gt;CloseEvent on itself. This changes is not related to Hydroph0bia at all, and the driver as it is will still trust a "shadowed" version of <em>SecureFlashCertData</em> if an attacker will be able to set it somehow.</p>
<p><em>SecureFlashDxe</em> got a fair amount of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the same replacement of "naked" <em>SetVariable</em> call with a <em>LibSetSecureVariable</em> call for setting the Insyde special variables, that <em>BdsDxe</em> has.</li>
<li>the same <em>ExitBootServices</em> event that <em>SecurityStubDxe</em> has.</li>
<li>additional countermeasure against variable shadowing was added to the entry point:
<img src="../hydroph0bia-part3/hp3_secureflashdxe_fix.png" alt="SecureFlashDxe fix" /></li>
</ul>
<p>This additional calls attempt to remove <em>SecureFlashSetupMode</em> and <em>SecureFlashCertData</em> variable, if they are set, and guarantee that even if they are set as a special Insyde variable with AW attribute, they will still be removed.</p>
<p>The driver also now registers a <em><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/mu/dyn/mu_basecore/MdeModulePkg/Library/VariablePolicyLib/ReadMe/">VariablePolicy</a></em> for both variables mentioned above, so that they could not be set from the OS. It is a newer mechanism that was previously used to protect <em>SecureFlashInfo</em> variable, but its default EDK2 implementation also <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/92c714f8b7482f69f6f66bf78b884feacec66fa1/MdeModulePkg/Library/VariablePolicyLib/VariablePolicyLib.c#L41">looks vulnerable</a> to the same "flip a global variable to disable the whole thing" approach we used to defeat <em>InsydeVariableLock</em> in <a href="../hydroph0bia-part2">part 2</a>. As I do not have any formally-affected-now-fixed HW to actually test that assertion, let's believe it actually does something, for now.</p>
<h1 id="does-this-fix-look-sound">Does this fix look sound?</h1>
<p>A short answer is <strong>"yes, conditionally"</strong>. The condition here is that an attacker will not find a way to set <em>SecureFlashCertData</em> variable in a way that will bypass both the <em>VariablePolicy</em> and the <em>LibSetSecureVariable</em>. It could be possible by manual NVRAM editing using SPI programming HW or a flash write protection bypass, and I expect this kind of attack to still work after the fix.</p>
<p>Physical attacks are of course out of scope for UEFI SecureBoot bypasses (because all the TA variables that SB trusts are stored in the same physical storage), but it still leaves the FW updater vulnerable to certificate hijacking (although it doesn't actually give an attacker any further capabilities if arbitrary flash write has already been achieved).</p>
<p>I do still believe that there's a much better way to fix the issue: <strong>STOP USING NVRAM FOR ANY SECURITY-SENSITIVE APPLICATIONS</strong>.</p>
<p>There's no need for <em>SecureFlashCertData</em> to be loaded in <em>BdsDxe</em>/<em>CapsuleRuntimeDxe</em>/<em>WhateverElseDxe</em> and then consumed by <em>SecurityStubDxe</em>. The latter might as well react to the presence of <em>SecureFlashSetupMode</em> trigger, then load the certs into memory using the very same <em>LoadCertificateToVariable</em> function once, then use it directly from memory to perform Authenticode verification for any amount of input files. The only possible regression I'd see with this approach is the case where downstream OEMs blindly copypasted the mechanism into their custom drivers, and it will end up broken for them when Insyde applies the update on their side. It is normal for security updates though, so "backwards compat" is a poor reason for not doing the fix properly.</p>
<p>I wrote to Tim Lewis (Insyde CTO) about the fix being somewhat weaker than I expected it to be, and got a reply from Kevin Devis (Insyde Security Strategist) saying that they did try to fix it <em>"the right way"</em>, encountered regressions, then had to do it the way it's currently done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nikolaj,</p>
<p>I dug into this a bit. We started on a fix based on your feedback. Unfortunately we ran into some regression issues and decided to fix “the easy way” for now.</p>
<p>In addition, we are creating an ECR for an engineer to investigate a solution that will not use variables. This way we mitigate the issue for now and improve the codebase even more later.</p>
<p>I’ll add a note to the task to circle back to you with the details of the change when it happens. It might take 6 months or so.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Kevin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is nice to see an IBV actually replying to emails, participating in responsible disclosure and coordination, releasing the advisories in time, etc. Way to go, Insyde folks!</p>
<h1 id="outro">Outro</h1>
<p>I've recently bought an Acer Swift Go 16 to be my personal device-under-test for further investigations into the Insyde H2O platform. The FW for it doesn't have Hydroph0bia fix yet, but it's properly set up to protect DXE volume using <em>FlashDeviceMap</em>, which in turn is properly protected by <em>Intel BootGuard</em>. I hope Acer didn't make any additional messes or add any vulnerabilities of their own, but now I can verify most of the assertions that EDK2, Insyde and Acer could make about security of that FW. Stay tuned.</p>
